Metric
  1. change metric from MAE to MPAE
Data Preprocessing
  1. normaliztion
  2. visualization for Price
  3. finding optimal outlier threshold
  4. After prediction check the rows in test data in which MAPE is highest(order based on MPAE)
Data Collection
  1. Finding way to solve captcha for more data features
  2. Getting more than 15,000 data
Model
  1. Random Forest (done) / currently best
  2. Gradient boosting (done)
  3. Linear Regression (done)
  4. Logistic Regression (done)
  5. Deep Learning
  6. Stacking

Trying codes on Kaggle that showed good result might also perform well on our datasets as well
Currently tried:
   Top 1%-üè°Housing Price[EDA+Random] for Everyoneü§ì
   StackingAndEnsembling (too difficult)
Should try:
  Top 1% Approach: EDA, New Models and Stacking
